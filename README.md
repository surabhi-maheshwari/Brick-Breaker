# Brick-Breaker
The game is designed in java.  Here is how simple brick game works. You have layers of colored bricks and a tossed up ball with which to break the layers. Controlling the momentum of the ball (usually a white ball) is a paddle which you have to maneuver from side to side. When the ball is bounced up by the paddle, it will hit a brick and then the brick is gone. After that the ball will come down, if the paddle misses the ball, game is over. Users can use the gamepad to control the position of paddle.
